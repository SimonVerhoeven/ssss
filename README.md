# Getting Started

First make sure you have the development tools for your platform installed: https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/native_software.html

For a native compilation we can perform `./mvnw native:compile -Pnative`.

You can use `help` to list the available commands.
An API key will need to be provided, either through the `greet` or `pinkyswear` command.
